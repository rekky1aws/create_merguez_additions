# Minecraft Datapack for the Create Merguez Modpack

Few recipes for the Create Merguez modpack I'm doing.

## Recipes
### Compacting
*The recipes for Mystical Agriculture are still there for compatibility purpose even if the modpack is now in version 2.0 and doesn't include this mod anymore.*

`Prudentium Essence`, `Tertium Essence`, `Imperium Essence` and `Supremium Essence` can be crafted with the same ingredients as their default crafting recipe in a `Basin` using a `Mechanical Press`. Note that an Infusion Crystal is still required, and the default recipes are still in the game.

### Splashing / Bulk Washing
 + Small chances of getting `Gold Nuggets` and smaller chances of getting `Netherite Ingots` from spraying `Water` on `Cinder Flour` with Mechanical Fan.

### Crushing
 + `Cobblestone` (and small chance of `Nugget of Experience`) can be obtained with `Stone` through Create's Crushing Wheel.
 + `Cobbled Deepslate` (and small chance of `Nugget of Experience`) can be obtained with `Deepslate` through Create's Crushing Wheel.

### Cobblestone Generator
 + `Calcite` can now be generated using Mechanical Generator.
 + `Netherrack` can now be generated using Mechanical Generator.

## Crafting Shapeless
 + `Mechanical Generator` in a crafting space to reset the item generated to nothing.
